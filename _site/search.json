    "text": "Overview\nThe purpose of this manual is to help new members and collaborators build a shared base of foundational knowledge for the kind of work we do in the Keller Lab Group. This is a collaborative, living document build with Quarto and hosted with GitHub Pages.\nThis manual details lab procedures, policies, and expectations for research group members (and may be helpful for collaborators to consult). The manual contains three sections:\n\nLab Values outlines the expectations we have for each other and ourselves to ensure a functional, healthy, and productive lab group; it is not a marketplace for Labrador Retrievers.\nOnboarding is your first stop as a new lab member (and may be helpful for others) to get your working environment and workflows set up.\nGuide is the home of our (always growing!) lab resources, how-tos, and tips for building a strong knowedge foundation for the kind of work we do in the group."
