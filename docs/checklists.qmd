## Coordinate with Klaus{#coordinate}

This document is available as a pdf (see the right margin) so that you may download and check/highlight items as you complete them. 

### Before first meeting

- [ ] Review [Lab Values](lab-values/index.qmd)
- [ ] Set up your calendar (e.g., Outlook)
- [ ] Set up your weekly meeting schedule
- [ ] Accept Klaus's invitation to our group's lab meeting GitHub repo
- [ ] Find out who to ask for lab meeting invite
- [ ] Find out who to ask for Slack workspace invite
- [ ] Find out who to ask for webpage profile
- [ ] Find out who to talk to at Irving or Thayer for your ID card, office access, etc., if you don't already know
- [ ] Discuss research interests and potential projects

### After first meeting
- [ ] Send photo, bio, contact, socials to web manager
  - [ ] Check out existing [profiles](https://keller-lab.github.io/people.html) for examples
- [ ] Join group Slack and browse/join channels
- [ ] [{{< fa envelope title="Email" >}} Thayer Computing](mailto:computing@thayer.dartmouth.edu) for access to Kasper and `jumbo/keller-lab/` and CC Klaus (he will tell computing gurus it is ok to add you)

### Before first lab meeting
- [ ] Check out the lab meeting [repo](https://github.com/keller-lab/lab-meetings) and add yourself to the next presentation block
  - Note: Depending on your experience level, you may find it helpful to consult [some examples](analysis/lab-github.qmd).
- [ ] Prepare a 5 minute max presentation to introduce yourself to the group
  - [ ] Review our [presentation guidelines](sci-comm/presentation-guidelines.qmd)

### Losing your training wheels
Now that you have followed these steps, your tasks in the group will become more organic and unique to your chosen path. There is some reading material we strongly recommend for all lab members (and Klaus may assign some), but you can otherwise go through the [reading list](materials/reading-list.qmd) as best suits your early exploration and planning stages. Otherwise, work through the tutorials in the [Guide](guide/index.qmd) and find [projects](materials/reproduce-repos.qmd) to reproduce! 


## Set up work environment{#setup}

If you work from a Dartmouth laptop, it will come equipped with a lot of helpful software and functionality. If not, you may have to contribute to the manual to offer guidance for setting up software, tools, etc., Either way, there are still set up steps you will have to follow, such as:

::: {.column-margin}
::: {.callout-note}
It would be great to have guide entries about selecting between various reference managers, and setting up our coding environments!
:::
:::

- [ ] Choose a reference manager (e.g., Zotero or Paperpile)
  - Many of us use Paperpile because of its Chrome plugin and integration into Google Docs, but Zotero might play better with collaborators and other workflows
- [ ] [Set up a GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github) if you don't have one already
- [ ] Configure your GitHub with [SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)
- [ ] Set up your coding environment 
  - Many of us use VSCode for our IDE. You can SSH onto Kasper or work locally through the same interface.  
  - Dartmouth also offers [FastX](https://services.dartmouth.edu/TDClient/1806/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=81595).
  - Or, you can run a Jupyter Notebook on Kasper or a HPC node. See [here](https://services.dartmouth.edu/TDClient/1806/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=124517).

While this is an incomplete list, it will hopefully be enough to get you going for the reading list and the guide <i class="fa-regular fa-face-grin-wide"></i>
