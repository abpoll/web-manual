* Many tutorials for general GitHub use cases
* There are a few things we expect you to use GitHub (or other version control) for. We provide guidance and examples for those uses cases on GitHub:
  - Contributing to our lab meetings GitHub
  - Contributing to this manual
  - Setting up a project; use j40_gc as example (plus see other guide on reproducible workflows) -> treat this as a kind of cookbook, not a complete tutorial
  - Maintaining a package (use UNSAFE as an example); principles from setting up a project apply but a few differences
