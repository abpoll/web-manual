This page is under construction! The content here is currently for planning purposes.

The idea of this page is to lay out *why* we care about science communication and providing context about the subsequent guides on being a good communicator for mediums such as presentations, papers, paper contracts, etc., Our goals might follow the message box format -> clear issue, audience, problem statement, so what, etc., Could change this from "goals" to "approach" as well.
